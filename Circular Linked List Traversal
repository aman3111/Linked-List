Given a circular linked list, your task is to complete the method printList() that prints the linked list.

Input:
The printList function takes a single argument as input the reference pointer to the head of the linked list.
There are multiple test cases and for each test, the function will be called separately. 
Output: You just need to print the LinkedList in the same line and the next line will be added by the Driver Code.

Example:

Input:
2
7
374 363 171 497 282 306 426
2
162 231
Output:
426 306 282 497 171 363 374
231 162

JAVA CODE:

/* Node of a linked list
 class Node{
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int x){
        data = x;
        next = null;
    }

}
*/

class Solution {
    /* Function to print nodes in a given Circular linked list */
    void printList(Node head) {
        // Your code here
        if(head == null) return;
        
        Node curr = head;
        do {
            System.out.print(curr.data + " ");
            curr = curr.next;
        } while (curr != head);
    }
}
